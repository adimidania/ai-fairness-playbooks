# 🤖 AI Fairness Playbooks

This repository contains a set of practical playbooks on **AI Fairness**, created as part of my AI Ethics specialization at *Turing College*.  

The goal of these playbooks is to provide structured, hands-on guides for auditing, intervening, and implementing fairness in AI systems. They are intended to be collaborative and continuously improved with community contributions. ✨
