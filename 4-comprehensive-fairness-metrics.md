# Comprehensive Fairness Metrics Tool 

## I. Purpose

This tool connects the **Fairness Definition Selection (FDS)** and **Bias Source Identification (BSI)** components to **quantitative fairness metrics**. It helps teams:

* Select the **right metrics** for their problem type.
* Implement and statistically validate those metrics.
* Interpret disparities **in context** of historical harms and fairness goals.

**What you should produce by the end:**

* A **Fairness Metrics Report** showing selected metrics, values, and confidence intervals.
* Visualizations highlighting disparities by group and intersection.
* A clear **interpretation summary**: which groups are impacted, how large the disparity is, and whether it aligns with FDS goals.
* Documentation to hand off to engineering or compliance teams for monitoring.

## II. Estimated Time & Effort

*(Adjust by model complexity and number of protected groups.)*

* **Small/simple project:** 2–4 hours (1–2 people)
* **Medium project:** 6–10 hours (2–3 people)
* **Large/regulated project:** 2–4 days (cross-functional, with legal review)

**Breakdown for a medium project:**

* Metric selection from FDS mapping → 1 hour
* Coding & implementation → 2–3 hours
* Statistical validation (bootstrap or Bayesian) → 2 hours
* Visualization and reporting → 1–2 hours
* Review and sign-off → 1 hour

## III. Who Should Be Involved

* **Fairness lead / Audit owner** — decides which metrics best align with goals.
* **Data scientist / ML engineer** — implements and validates metrics in code.
* **Product or domain lead** — ensures metrics reflect real-world harm, not just math.
* **Legal / Compliance** — checks regulatory standards (e.g., EEOC, GDPR).
* **Optional:** UX researcher or social scientist to contextualize results.

> **Small team note:** This can be run solo. If so, document assumptions clearly.

### 2. Map fairness definitions to metrics

| Fairness Definition | Problem Type                 | Recommended Metric                                           |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Equal Opportunity   | Classification               | TPR / FNR Difference                                         |
| Equalized Odds      | Classification               | TPR + FPR Difference                                         |
| Demographic Parity  | Classification               | Demographic Parity Difference                                |
| Calibration         | Classification or Regression | Calibration Slope / Reliability Curve                        |
| Bounded Group Loss  | Regression                   | Group Error Ratio                                            |
| Exposure Parity     | Ranking                      | Exposure Ratio                                               |
| Individual Fairness | Any                          | Consistency Score / Rank Distance / Input-Output Sensitivity |

Use the template below to document your selections:

* **Your Problem Type:** \[Classification/Regression/Ranking]
* **Selected Fairness Definitions:** \[List]
* **Chosen Metrics:** \[List]

### Example

* **Loan approval classifier**

  * FDS output → Equal Opportunity (focus on false negatives for minority applicants)
  * Metric → FNR Difference (between protected group and baseline)
  * Computed result → FNR = 0.28 (group A) vs. 0.10 (group B) → Difference = **0.18** (critical)

## V. Statistical Validation

When you calculate a fairness metric on your dataset, it’s just one estimate. What if your sample is small, or random chance makes Group B look worse than it really is? Statistical validation checks if your metric is reliable, not just a fluke.

### Bootstrap Confidence Intervals

Think of bootstrapping as “stress-testing” your metric:

1. Randomly resample your dataset **with replacement** to make a new dataset of the same size.
2. Recompute your fairness metric on this resample.
3. Repeat thousands of times (e.g., 10,000).
4. Look at the distribution of all these metric values.
5. Take the middle 95% — that’s your **confidence interval**.

**Why it helps:**

* If the interval is **narrow**, your metric is trustworthy.
* If it’s **wide**, the disparity might just be random fluctuation.

### Bayesian Estimation for Small Groups (<100 samples)

If some subgroups have very few samples, bootstrap alone isn’t enough. Bayesian estimation adds “guardrails” by starting with a mild assumption (a **prior**) that group rates shouldn’t be wildly different unless data strongly says so.

1. Choose a **weakly informative prior** — not too strict, just enough to keep estimates reasonable.
2. Combine the prior with your data to get a **posterior distribution** for the fairness metric.
3. Take the middle 95% of this posterior — that’s your **credible interval**.

**Why it helps:**

* Prevents overreacting to tiny sample quirks.
* The credible interval says, “Given your data and assumptions, there’s a 95% chance the true disparity is inside this range.”

## VI. Visualization and Reporting Templates

Good charts make fairness results **immediately clear to both engineers and non-technical reviewers**. Show both **the disparity** and **how confident you are in it**.

### Fairness Disparity Chart

* **What it is:** A bar chart showing metric values by group, with error bars for uncertainty.
* **What it shows:**

  * Which groups are doing worse or better.
  * Whether gaps are large enough to be real (not just noise).
* **Pro tip:** Use color to highlight any disparity that crosses a policy or regulatory threshold.

---

### Intersectional Heatmap

* **What it is:** A grid showing disparities for combinations of attributes (e.g., gender × age).
* **What it shows:**

  * Whether bias appears only for single attributes or at intersections.
  * Where sample sizes are small (use lighter color or transparency to signal this).
* **Pro tip:** Annotate each cell with sample size or interval width — so nobody mistakes noise for a real issue.

### Example output

| Group | False Negative Rate | 95% CI        |
| ----- | ------------------- | ------------- |
| A     | 0.28                | \[0.24, 0.33] |
| B     | 0.10                | \[0.08, 0.13] |

> **Interpretation:** Protected group A is nearly **3×** more likely to receive false rejections. Urgent remediation required.

## VII. Step-by-Step Methodology

1. **Select metrics** — based on FDS fairness definition and problem type.
2. **Implement code** — calculate metric per protected group.
3. **Validate statistically** — use bootstrap or Bayesian estimates.
4. **Visualize disparities** — bar charts or heatmaps with uncertainty.
5. **Interpret results** — decide if disparities align with fairness goals.
6. **Document findings** — record metrics, values, CI, interpretation.
7. **Plan monitoring** — integrate selected metrics into dashboards.

## VIII. Final Validation Checklist

* [ ] **Have we linked fairness definitions to metric choices?**
* [ ] **Were metrics computed on the full validation/test set?**
* [ ] **Do we report confidence/credible intervals for every metric?**
* [ ] **Do charts clearly show disparities by group and intersection?**
* [ ] **Do we explain who is harmed and how?**
* [ ] **Does any critical gap (>0.1 FNR, >20% DP) have a mitigation owner?**
* [ ] **Are metrics wired into ongoing monitoring?**
* [ ] **Is the Fairness Metrics Report ready for handoff?**

**Pass rule:** At least 80% complete. Any **critical disparity (>0.1 FNR gap, >20% DP gap, etc.)** must have a mitigation plan or owner assigned.
