# Post-Processing Fairness Toolkit

## I. Introduction

This toolkit provides a structured, reproducible way to apply fairness interventions **after** a model is trained — at the prediction/decision layer — so you can mitigate unfair outcomes without changing the model internals.

### Why we do it

* Apply fairness fixes when retraining is impossible (third-party models, legacy systems, black-box APIs).
* Rapidly deploy mitigations with low engineering cost.
* Balance fairness and utility through transparent, auditable post-processing rules.
* Provide operational controls (thresholds, calibrators, transformations, rejection policies).
* Document decisions for compliance and monitoring.
> _💡: If you want to learn more about casual fairness so that you take the most out of this component, go ahead and read the notes available on [**the appendix**](./7-appendix.md)_.

### Outcome (what you should produce)

* A short **Post-Processing Report** (2–4 pages) containing:

  1. Validation dataset split and group breakdown.
  2. Chosen post-processing pattern(s) and rationale.
  3. Selected thresholds / calibration models / transformation functions.
  4. Quantified fairness vs. performance trade-offs.
  5. Integration plan (how to apply at prediction time).
  6. Monitoring & rollback rules.

### How to Navigate This Component

### 1. Threshold Optimization

Every classifier works with a threshold (e.g., 0.5 probability = “positive”). But different groups may systematically get different score distributions. Threshold Optimization allows us to **set different thresholds per group** so that fairness criteria like *equal opportunity* or *demographic parity* are achieved. This doesn’t mean changing the model — instead, we **recalibrate decisions at prediction time**.

#### When to Use

* ✅ Binary classification tasks (loan approval, hiring, recidivism prediction).
* ✅ When fairness goals are clearly defined (e.g., equal opportunity or demographic parity).
* ✅ When you have access to protected attributes during inference (for group-specific thresholds).

#### Supported Fairness Criteria

| Criterion              | Mathematical Definition               | Practical Meaning                                 |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Demographic Parity** | P(Ŷ=1 | A=a) = P(Ŷ=1 | A=b)           | Equal positive prediction rates across groups     |
| **Equal Opportunity**  | P(Ŷ=1 | Y=1, A=a) = P(Ŷ=1 | Y=1, A=b) | Equal True Positive Rates (TPR) across groups     |
| **Equalized Odds**     | TPR and FPR equal across groups       | Equal error rates for fairness + accuracy balance |

#### Constraint Handling

* **With Protected Attributes (direct method):**

  * Use group-specific thresholds.
  * Highest fairness accuracy but may require legal/ethical review.

* **Without Protected Attributes (proxy method):**

  * Approximate groups with clusters or proxies.
  * Less accurate but sometimes necessary for compliance.

#### ROC-Based Threshold Selection

The **ROC curve** (Receiver Operating Characteristic) shows the tradeoff between:

* **TPR** (True Positive Rate, how many actual positives you catch),
* **FPR** (False Positive Rate, how many negatives you mistakenly accept).

For each threshold value, you get a different (TPR, FPR).

👉 So, ROC-based threshold selection means:

* For each group, look at its ROC curve.
* Decide on a **target fairness criterion** (e.g., “everyone should have the same TPR”).
* Pick the threshold **for each group** that achieves that target.

⚠️ **Important Note: Intersectional Fairness**
It’s not enough to balance thresholds for broad groups (e.g., male vs female). Always check **intersections** (e.g., *Black women*, *Latino men*) since fairness can appear fine across single attributes but fail in combined subgroups.

### 2. Calibration Across Groups
Threshold optimization adjusts decision cutoffs (who gets a positive vs. negative prediction). In contrast, calibration adjusts the predicted probabilities themselves, making sure that a “70% risk score” actually means the same thing across groups. So instead of asking “Where do we cut off?”, calibration asks _“Can we trust these scores equally for everyone?”_.

To illustrate the problem, sometimes even accurate models can be **miscalibrated across groups**:

* Model says **70% risk** → actually **85%** for Group A
* Model says **70% risk** → actually **55%** for Group B

This leads to **systematic unfairness**.

Calibration ensures predicted probabilities have consistent meaning across demographic groups

**When to Use:**

* Probability outputs are directly interpreted (e.g., 0.7 = 70% risk)
* Risk assessment applications (credit scoring, medical risk prediction)
* Need consistent score interpretation across demographics

**Calibration Techniques**

* **Platt Scaling**: Fits a simple **logistic regression** on top of model scores for each group to map raw outputs into well-calibrated probabilities. It assumes a roughly **sigmoid-shaped relationship** between scores and true probabilities.

* **Isotonic Regression**: A **non-parametric calibration method** that fits a flexible, monotonic function between scores and outcomes. It preserves the **ranking of predictions** but corrects distortions in probability estimates.

* **Temperature Scaling**: A lightweight technique often used in **neural networks** that rescales logits by a single temperature parameter. It adjusts the **confidence level of predictions** without changing their relative order.

**Evaluation Metric**

When a model says **“70% probability”**, we want that to actually mean: *in the real world, about 70 out of 100 such cases should be positive*. If instead only 50 out of 100 are positive, the model is **overconfident**. If 90 out of 100 are positive, it’s **underconfident**.

**Expected Calibration Error (ECE)** measures this gap by:

1. Splitting predictions into bins (e.g., 0–0.1, 0.1–0.2, …).
2. For each bin, comparing the **average predicted probability** vs the **actual frequency** of positives.
3. Taking a weighted average of these differences across bins.

So, a **low ECE** means “when the model says 70%, it really happens ~70% of the time.”
A **high ECE** means the probabilities don’t line up with reality — they look confident, but don’t reflect actual outcomes.

> 📌 **Impossibility Result** (Kleinberg et al., 2016):
You cannot have all three at once (unless groups have identical base rates):
> 
> * Calibration
> * Equal False Positive Rate
> * Equal False Negative Rate
> *Always document which trade-off you accept*

### 3. Prediction Transformation Methods

Prediction Transformation is different: instead of changing thresholds or probabilities directly, **it reshapes the distribution of predictions themselves**. This allows you to align scores across groups while preserving the relative ranking within each group.

#### When to Use

* ✅ You need to **preserve ranking** (who is above/below who) within each group.
* ✅ Used in **recommendation systems or scoring systems** (e.g., credit scoring).
* ✅ You **cannot access the model internals** (black-box models).

Prediction Transformation Methods  can be organized into **two categories**

#### Learned Transformation Functions

Here, we train a small correction function *per group* that reshapes the predictions. These functions are fitted using the group’s data, and then applied so that group outputs align with fairness goals.

* **Monotonic Transformation (Isotonic Regression):**
  Learns a smooth, increasing mapping so that scores are better calibrated, but the ranking order within each group is preserved.

* **Quantile Transformation:**
  Matches each group’s prediction distribution to a reference (e.g., the overall distribution). This ensures groups are treated comparably, even if their original score distributions differ.

👉 Think of this as **re-scaling scores** so that all groups are placed on a fair playing field without distorting internal rankings.

#### Distribution Alignment Techniques

Instead of fitting per-group functions, these methods directly align *entire score distributions* across groups.

* **Quantile Matching:**
  Aligns percentiles across groups — e.g., the 90th percentile of Group A’s distribution is mapped to the 90th percentile of Group B’s. This makes scores across groups directly comparable.

* **Optimal Transport:**
  A more advanced method that finds the “least expensive” way to move probability mass from one group’s distribution to another. Think of it like carefully rebalancing two uneven piles of sand so they match in shape, while minimizing unnecessary movement.

### 4. Rejection Option Classification

While threshold optimization, calibration, and prediction transformation all try to *adjust model outputs to be fairer*, **Rejection Option Classification takes a step back and says:** *“Sometimes, the model shouldn’t decide at all.”*

If the system is not confident, or if the prediction looks like it might carry fairness risk, it can simply **reject the prediction** and pass it to a human reviewer. This is particularly valuable in **high-stakes scenarios** such as healthcare, credit approval, or hiring where mistakes or unfair treatment can cause significant harm.

Adding a rejection option only works if the human-in-the-loop process is thoughtfully designed:

* **Interface Principles:** Don’t reveal protected attributes, but provide uncertainty indicators and reasons for deferral.
* **Feedback Loop:** Log human reviewers’ decisions and disagreements with the model, then use this feedback to update thresholds and improve future performance.

👉 This way, the system becomes a **collaborative workflow**: the model handles the “clear” cases efficiently, and humans focus on the difficult, high-risk ones.

#### When to Use

* High-stakes applications where errors are costly.
* When you have access to human reviewers for escalation.
* When fairness is uncertain for some subgroups and cannot be fully solved algorithmically.

We have two main approaches:

#### 1. **Confidence-Based Rejection**

The model learns a confidence threshold for each group. If a prediction falls below that threshold, the case is marked as *REJECTED* and routed to a human.

* Example: A credit scoring model is 95% confident for most applicants, but only 60% confident for a subgroup. Low-confidence cases for that subgroup are automatically flagged for human review.

#### 2. **Cost-Sensitive Rejection**

Not all errors are equally bad. This approach considers the **costs of false positives, false negatives, and human reviews**. The system sets rejection thresholds that minimize the *overall expected cost*.

* Example: In a medical diagnosis system, a false negative (missing a disease) might be far more costly than a false positive. The rejection rule is designed to minimize such costly mistakes while balancing review workload.

## V. Technique Selection Decision Tree

There isn’t a single “best” method for algorithmic fairness; the right choice depends on your goals, constraints, and model outputs. To help guide this decision, you can use the following decision tree as a practical reference.

* **What is your primary fairness goal?**

  * Demographic parity → threshold adjustment or score transform.
  * Equal opportunity → threshold adjustment (TPR equalization) or calibration + thresholding.
  * Equalized odds → threshold pairs or randomized post-processing.
  * Calibration across groups → group-specific calibration models.

* **What are your deployment constraints?**

  * Protected attribute available at inference → can use group-specific rules directly.
  * Not allowed → use derived features, multi-threshold schemes, or group-blind transforms.

* **What is your output type?**

  * Probabilities → prefer calibration + thresholding.
  * Raw scores only → score transforms or decision flipping.
  * Binary decisions only → decision flipping or randomized post-processing.

* **What are your real-time requirement?**

  * Low latency → simple threshold or parametric calibration (temperature).
  * Tight latency → precomputed lookup / light weight transforms.



## VI. Implementation Pattern Catalog
This catalog shows how to implement the **four main fairness intervention methods** mentioned above.

### 1. Threshold Optimization
This is a reusable class to learn and apply **group-specific thresholds**:

```python
class ThresholdOptimizer:
    def __init__(self, fairness_criterion='equal_opportunity'):
        self.fairness_criterion = fairness_criterion
        self.thresholds = {}
    
    def fit(self, y_scores, y_true, protected_attrs):
        """Learn optimal thresholds per group"""
        for group in protected_attrs.unique():
            mask = (protected_attrs == group)
            group_scores = y_scores[mask]
            group_labels = y_true[mask]
            
            # Find threshold maximizing utility subject to fairness
            self.thresholds[group] = self._optimize_threshold(
                group_scores, group_labels, self.fairness_criterion
            )
    
    def predict(self, y_scores, protected_attrs):
        """Apply group-specific thresholds"""
        predictions = np.zeros_like(y_scores)
        for group in self.thresholds:
            mask = (protected_attrs == group)
            predictions[mask] = (y_scores[mask] >= self.thresholds[group])
        return predictions
```

This function finds thresholds that equalize **TPR across groups** (useful for Equal Opportunity).

```python
def find_fair_thresholds(y_scores, y_true, groups):
    """
    Find thresholds that equalize TPR across groups
    """
    thresholds = {}
    
    # Step 1: Find achievable TPR range for each group
    tpr_ranges = {}
    for group in groups.unique():
        mask = (groups == group)
        fpr, tpr, thresh = roc_curve(y_true[mask], y_scores[mask])
        tpr_ranges[group] = (tpr.min(), tpr.max())
    
    # Step 2: Find a common target TPR across groups
    max_min_tpr = max(r[0] for r in tpr_ranges.values())
    min_max_tpr = min(r[1] for r in tpr_ranges.values())
    target_tpr = (max_min_tpr + min_max_tpr) / 2
    
    # Step 3: Select thresholds achieving that TPR
    for group in groups.unique():
        mask = (groups == group)
        fpr, tpr, thresh = roc_curve(y_true[mask], y_scores[mask])
        idx = np.argmin(np.abs(tpr - target_tpr))
        thresholds[group] = thresh[idx]
    
    return thresholds, target_tpr
```

### 3. Prediction Transformation Methods
These snippets implement the prediction transformation techniques.

```python
from sklearn.isotonic import IsotonicRegression
from sklearn.preprocessing import QuantileTransformer
import numpy as np

class FairTransformer:
    def __init__(self, transformation_type='monotonic'):
        self.transformation_type = transformation_type
        self.transformers = {}
    
    def fit(self, predictions, protected_attrs, labels):
        """Learn group-specific transformations"""
        for group in np.unique(protected_attrs):
            mask = (protected_attrs == group)
            group_preds = predictions[mask]
            group_labels = labels[mask]
            
            if self.transformation_type == 'monotonic':
                # Isotonic regression preserving order
                transformer = IsotonicRegression(out_of_bounds='clip')
                transformer.fit(group_preds, group_labels)
            elif self.transformation_type == 'quantile':
                # Quantile-based transformation
                transformer = QuantileTransformer(output_distribution="uniform")
                transformer.fit(group_preds.reshape(-1, 1))
            
            self.transformers[group] = transformer
    
    def transform(self, predictions, protected_attrs):
        """Apply learned transformations"""
        transformed = np.zeros_like(predictions)
        for group in self.transformers:
            mask = (protected_attrs == group)
            if self.transformation_type == 'monotonic':
                transformed[mask] = self.transformers[group].transform(
                    predictions[mask]
                )
            elif self.transformation_type == 'quantile':

                ).flatten()
        return transformed
```

**Quantile Matching**

```python
def quantile_alignment(scores_source, scores_target, n_quantiles=100):
    """Align score distributions using quantile mapping"""
    # Compute quantiles for both distributions
    quantiles = np.linspace(0, 1, n_quantiles)
    source_quantiles = np.quantile(scores_source, quantiles)
    target_quantiles = np.quantile(scores_target, quantiles)
    
    # Create mapping function
    def transform_score(score):
        # Find position in source distribution
        pos = np.searchsorted(source_quantiles, score) / len(source_quantiles)
        # Map to target distribution
        return np.interp(pos, quantiles, target_quantiles)
    
    return np.vectorize(transform_score)
```

### 4. Rejection Option Classification
The following code implementations demonstrate three complementary approaches for integrating rejection and human oversight into post-processing fairness workflows.

#### Confidence-Based Rejection

```python
class FairRejectionClassifier:
    def __init__(self, confidence_threshold=0.8, fairness_threshold=0.1):
        self.confidence_threshold = confidence_threshold
        self.fairness_threshold = fairness_threshold
        self.group_thresholds = {}
    
    def fit(self, predictions, confidence, protected_attrs, labels):
        """Learn group-specific rejection thresholds"""
        for group in protected_attrs.unique():
            mask = (protected_attrs == group)
            group_conf = confidence[mask]
            group_pred = predictions[mask]
            group_true = labels[mask]
            
            # Placeholder for custom optimization logic
            self.group_thresholds[group] = np.quantile(group_conf, 0.2)
    
    def predict_with_rejection(self, predictions, confidence, protected_attrs):
        """Make predictions with rejection option"""
        result = []
        for i, (pred, conf, group) in enumerate(zip(predictions, confidence, protected_attrs)):
            if conf < self.group_thresholds[group]:
                result.append('REJECT')  # Defer to human
            else:
                result.append(pred)
        return np.array(result)
```

## VII. Integration & Verification Framework

Fairness interventions inside the training process — such as regularization, adversarial debiasing, constraint-based optimization, or multi-objective learning — must be carefully **integrated and verified**. These methods directly shape how the model learns, so we need to ensure that fairness improvements are real, stable, and don’t come at an unacceptable performance cost.
This framework provides a structured path from integration to final validation, ensuring reliable, interpretable, and reproducible outcomes.

### **Integration Workflow**

1. **Assessment Phase**

   * Evaluate baseline fairness metrics (e.g., demographic parity, equal opportunity).
   * Identify where intervention can help (e.g., unequal TPRs, biased gradients, imbalance in loss impact).
   * Document operational and regulatory limits (e.g., sensitive attributes available only during training).

2. **Method Selection**

   * Choose suitable in-processing techniques based on the fairness gap type (e.g., constraint-based regularization, adversarial debiasing, or fairness-aware loss).
   * Combine complementary methods if beneficial (e.g., regularization + adversarial learning).
   * Define measurable goals for fairness improvement and acceptable performance trade-offs before implementation.

3. **Application Phase**

   * Integrate fairness constraints or loss terms **within the training loop**.
   * Track both fairness and performance metrics across epochs.
   * Validate model behavior on a hold-out or validation dataset to avoid overfitting fairness metrics.

4. **Monitoring & Maintenance**

   * Continuously monitor fairness, calibration, and predictive performance post-deployment.
   * Detect and respond to **data or fairness drift** (e.g., changing group distributions).
   * Re-train, fine-tune, or adjust fairness parameters periodically to sustain performance balance.

### **Verification Framework**

1. **Baseline Evaluation**

   * Record initial metrics on the unmodified model:

     * Performance: Accuracy, F1, AUC.
     * Fairness: Demographic Parity Difference, Equal Opportunity Difference.
   * Use this as the baseline reference before applying in-processing adjustments.

2. **Fairness-Enhanced Validation**

   * Recompute metrics after applying fairness-aware training.
   * Compare **Δ fairness improvement** vs **Δ performance impact** (e.g., fairness ↑ ≥10%, accuracy ↓ ≤5%).
   * Visualize performance–fairness trade-offs per group and over time.

3. **Robustness Testing**

   * Assess **subgroup** and **intersectional fairness** (e.g., *Black female*, *older immigrant*).
   * Test stability across multiple random seeds and data splits.
   * Perform sensitivity analysis for fairness hyperparameters (e.g., λ strength, adversarial loss weight).

4. **Deployment Readiness**

   * Confirm consistent fairness gains and reproducibility across runs.
   * Ensure no new bias emerges in unmonitored groups.
   * Document a concise **verification report** summarizing fairness outcomes, performance stability, and monitoring strategy.

⚠️ **Note on Intersectional Fairness (Critical Reminder)**
Always evaluate fairness not only across individual protected groups but also across their **intersections** — for example, *Black women*, *older immigrants*, or *young disabled individuals*. Models can appear fair when looking at single attributes but still hide severe biases at these intersections, which often affect the most vulnerable populations. Intersectional validation ensures that fairness improvements are **holistic, not superficial**.


## VIII. Deliverables

* **Post-Processing Summary Report (2–4 pages)** — outlining chosen methods, setup, and results.
* **Code Templates** — for threshold tuning, calibration, prediction transformation, and rejection handling.
* **Integration Workflow** — showing how post-processing connects to model outputs in production.
* **Evaluation Results** — fairness and performance metrics before and after post-processing.
* **Visualization & Interpretation** — plots or tables showing trade-offs and fairness improvements.
* **Monitoring & Maintenance Plan** — outlining metrics to track and frequency of updates.

## IX. Validation Checklist
* [ ] Did we record both **baseline** and **post-processing** metrics for fairness and performance?
* [ ] Did we confirm that **fairness improved** without unacceptable performance degradation?
* [ ] Did we validate across **all subgroups** and **intersectional combinations** (e.g., gender × ethnicity)?
* [ ] Did we check that the results are **consistent across random seeds or multiple runs**?
* [ ] Did we visualize or explain how **thresholds or calibration** affected predictions?
* [ ] Did we verify that the post-processing method can be **integrated into the production pipeline**?
* [ ] Did we include clear **code, metrics, and discussion** in the report?
* [ ] Are fairness improvements **stable under data drift** or minor distribution changes?
* [ ] Did we **document limitations and next steps** (e.g., retraining, additional metrics)?
