# Fairness Intervention Playbook

## I. Introduction

This playbook walks you through a structured, practical **fairness intervention** for your AI project. It’s designed for:

* AI developers and data scientists
* Fairness or ethics leads
* Cross-functional team members (e.g., product managers, domain experts)
* Anyone who wants to ensure their AI system is fair, accountable, and trustworthy

**What you’ll do here:** You’ll learn how to select an intervention strategy, apply mitigation techniques, validate outcomes, and maintain fairness over time; all through a modular, reproducible framework.

## II. Why Fairness Interventions Matter

After identifying fairness issue (if you didn't, please check the Fairness Audit Playbook), the next challenge is **how to fix it responsibly**.

Fairness interventions bridge the gap between detection and deployment by ensuring that models and processes evolve toward equity.

**Why this matters:**

* **Accountability:** Moves fairness from theory into measurable action.
* **Trust:** Builds transparency with stakeholders through consistent, monitored improvements.
* **Sustainability:** Ensures fairness persists as data or contexts change.
* **Intersectional Impact:** Prevents single-axis solutions by addressing overlapping group harms (e.g., gender × race).

## III. What This Playbook Helps You Achieve

* **Actionable Mitigation:** Choose the right intervention for your context — pre-processing level, in-processing level, or post processing level.
* **Validation Framework:** Verify that interventions actually reduce bias without harming performance.
* **Continuous Monitoring:** Build fairness checks into your lifecycle, not just one-time reports.
* **Cross-Team Alignment:** Ensure fairness interventions fit business, ethical, and legal expectations.

---

## IV. Quick Relevance Check

Use this playbook if your system:

* Has completed a fairness audit.
* Shows measurable disparities in performance or outcomes.
* Impacts humans in sensitive or regulated domains (e.g., credit, healthcare, hiring).
* Operates in settings with multiple intersecting protected attributes.

---

## V. Implementation Considerations

### 1. Required Resources

* **People:** Data scientists, fairness engineers, domain experts, compliance/legal support.
* **Data:** Access to pre- and post-intervention data, including protected attributes.
* **Tools:** Fairness metrics libraries, model explainability tools, and visualization dashboards.

### 2. Workflow Integration

* Incorporate interventions during **model retraining or deployment**, not post-release.
* Embed **validation notebooks** and fairness dashboards into MLOps or CI/CD pipelines.
* Track fairness alongside model accuracy, using the same performance monitoring systems.

### 3. Time Investment

* **Design & Selection:** 1–2 weeks
* **Validation & Refinement:** 1–2 cycles post-intervention
* **Monitoring:** Continuous (automated ideally)

## VI. The Four Core Components

Here’s what you’ll tackle and why each step matters:

1. **Causal Fairness Toolkit**

   *What it does:* Helps you uncover **where and how bias arises** in your system by analyzing causal relationships between features, protected attributes, and outcomes.

   *Why it matters:* Understanding the **cause** of unfairness lets you intervene effectively — instead of just correcting symptoms in the data or predictions.

   *Explore more:* [causal_fairness_toolkit.md](./1-casual-fairness-toolkit.md)

2. **Pre-Processing Fairness Toolkit**

   *What it does:* Focuses on **data-level interventions** before training. It includes rebalancing samples, reweighting groups, and learning fair data representations.

   *Why it matters:* Many fairness issues come from biased data. Fixing it early ensures your model learns from **fairer, more representative inputs**, reducing the need for complex corrections later.

   *Explore more:* [preprocessing_toolkit.md](./2-pre-processing-toolkit.md)

3. **In-Processing Fairness Toolkit**

   *What it does:* Introduces fairness constraints and objectives **during training**. It can use adversarial debiasing, fairness regularization, or multi-objective optimization to balance fairness and performance.

   *Why it matters:* This approach directly shapes how the model learns, creating a **structurally fair model** rather than relying on post-hoc corrections.

   *Explore more:* [in_processing_toolkit.md](./3-in-processing-toolkit.md)

4. **Post-Processing Fairness Toolkit**

   *What it does:* Applies fairness corrections **after the model is trained**, such as adjusting thresholds, calibrating scores, or transforming outputs to improve fairness across groups.

   *Why it matters:* It’s the **most practical and least intrusive** way to mitigate bias when retraining isn’t possible — ideal for production models already in use.

   *Explore more:* [post_processing_toolkit.md](./4-post-processing-toolkit.md)


### How These Components Connect

Each toolkit addresses fairness at a **different stage of the AI lifecycle**, but they are most powerful when used together in sequence:

* **Causal Fairness Toolkit** lays the foundation, it helps you **understand the origins of bias** and identify the right points for intervention. Its insights guide every subsequent step.

* **Pre-Processing Fairness Toolkit** acts on those insights by **cleaning or transforming the data** before model training. It ensures that your training data doesn’t reinforce historical or structural bias.

* **In-Processing Fairness Toolkit** then **builds fairness into the model itself** during training. It aligns the learning process with fairness goals using constraints, regularizers, or adversarial setups.

* **Post-Processing Fairness Toolkit** is your final safeguard It fine-tunes model outputs after training — useful for **production models** or when retraining isn’t feasible.

Together, these form a **complete fairness pipeline**:

> *Detect → Prevent → Embed → Adjust.*

You can use one or combine multiple stages depending on your project’s maturity, constraints, and access to data or model internals.

⚙️ **Note:**
Fairness intervention is an **iterative process**, not a one-time fix. After deployment and continuous monitoring, results may reveal new disparities or shifts in data distribution
When that happens, teams should loop back — revisit earlier stages (e.g., causal or pre-processing) and **refine interventions** to maintain fairness over time.

To see how it works in a real case, follow along in the [**case study**](./5-case-study.md) that applies all four steps in sequence.

## VII. How to Use This Playbook

* **Go in order.** Start with the first notebook and move to the next only after completing it.
* **Take your time.** Understand the approaches, implement carefully, test thoroughly, and validate your results.
* **Study the case study.** It illustrates how each component comes together in a real AI project.
* **Use the validation steps.** Every notebook includes a validation section, be sure to follow it to confirm you’ve covered everything.
